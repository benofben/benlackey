# Cheap Plastic Garbage

In the genre of poorly thought out business plans on Tik Tok, I saw "comb through old patents and then make the things in them."  I think the thought is to fight the spread of plastic junk a la [this](https://x.com/internetofshit).

Speed Queen washers seem like a step in that direction.

We got an Oster blender from Mexico that follows that model too, though the jar was plastic.  The listing is now removed from Amazon.  I wonder if that was safety regulations or Oster US not wanting the competition.
