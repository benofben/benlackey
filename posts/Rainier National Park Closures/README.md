Update 1/20/26 -- NPS has [reopened Paradise 7 days a week](https://mynorthwest.com/chokepoints/paradise-mount-rainier/4179902) as of 12/30/25.  This happened about a month after I sent this letter.  I wonder if I had some impact here.  It appears that Rainier specifically was in violation of an executive order to reopen from earlier in the year.

Rainier is still being grumpy about it.  They're closing the road at 4pm.  And they're closing the road irregularly some days citing weather and staffing.  My suspicion is that is a form of civil disobedience against the presidential administration.  Personally, I'd like to see staff engaging in that sort of protest cleared out of the NPS.  They have completely forgotten why tax payers fund their salaries.

# Rainier National Park Closures

<p><img src="IMG_7599.jpg" width="300"></p>

This is a letter I sent to the Department of the Interior.

Dear Mr Burgum,

I was heartened to see the [recent changes to the America the Beautiful Pass](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/department-interior-announces-modernized-more-affordable-national-park-access).  It looks like the current administration is trying to resolve some barriers to access to our National Parks.  I pine for the days before that pass existed when the only fee to enter the park was the tax dollars I already pay.

An idea referred to as [fortress conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress_conservation) has taken hold in the Park Service.  The thought is that public lands should be blocked off.  Doing so will preserve them in a supposedly ideal state without people.  It's foolhardy because it robs the public of our lands.  It doesn't even accomplish preservation as a public unable to access its public lands has little impetus to preserve them.

Today I'm writing you specifically about Rainier National Park.  We live nearby in Tacoma.  I've been disappointed to see lands increasingly closed at the Park.  On 11/30/25 we observed an incident where a ranger shouted at a group of people about sledding, saying "this isn't a recreation area."

It betrays a fundamental lack of understanding.  Parks are recreation areas.  It is the job of that ranger to make those parks available to the public who pays his salary.  This isn't an accident, it's policy.  The current superintendent of Rainier, Greg Dudgeon, has accelerated policies blocking off public lands.  You can read a bit about him here:

There are numerous closures impacting Rainier, some going back decades.  Examples include:

## Carbon River Entrance
* Carbon River Road - This road washed out 20 years ago.  Rather than repairing it, NPS declared it a bike path and stopped maitanining it.  The road has fallen into worse and worse repair.  The road is the approach to Carbon Glacier, 10 miles up.  Closing the road has made it difficult to approach the Glacier.
* [Fairfax Bridge](https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/carbon-river-and-mowich.htm) - This is a WSDOT issue that impacts NPS.  WSDOT failed to paint the bridge for decades.  The bridge has rusted away.  A few years ago they reduced the weight limit on it.  This year they've closed it entirely.  That has closed two entrances to Rainier - Mowitch Lake and Carbonado.

## Sunrise Entrance
* Sunrise Lodge - The Sunrise entrance to Rainier originally had a lodge for park visitors.  NPS closed that to visitors.  They use it as administrative offices.  The entrance is closed entirely for much of the year.

## Longmire Entrance
* Paradise Lodge - Paradise Lodge has hotel rooms for visitors.  Those are closed during the winter.  They would be enormously popular with skiers if kept open, provding additional revenue from a lodge we already have.
* Paradise Gate - NPS has taken to regularly closing the gate to Paradise.  They close it at 4pm, locking visitors in.  They then force visitors to walk to Longmire Lodge and ask a ranger to unlock the gate.  This seems to be done intentionally, in an effort to embarrass and discourage park visitors.
* Road to Paradise - As recently as five years ago the road to Paradise was open 7 days a week.  At one point it was down to 2 days a week.  NPS is back up to 3 days a week.
* West Side Road washed out 20 years ago.  Rather than repair the road, NPS has declared it another bike path.
* Longmire Visitor Center - The visitor center is closed most days.
* Timed Entry - With these closures, the Longmire entrance has become busier and busier.  NPS says it is now too busy and has instituted a timed entry system to restrict the number of visitors to Rainier.  They've even put out to public comment ideas like banning cars in the park entirely.  This seems very cheeky.  First close entrances.  Then claim the remaining one is too busy, so restrict it.

## Basic Maintenance - 
I've encountered issues again and again where a ranger is present but not performing maintenance.  

At Paradise this past weekend it was 2pm.  A ranger was scolding visitors hiking, reminding them the gate would be shut a 4pm.  He could have been doing needed productive work such as shoveling the steps covered in snow instead.

Similarly, I remember an incident at Comet Falls in Rainier.  A log that had served as a bridge had washed away.  Rather than cutting a new log, the ranger was discouraging visitors from hiking the trail and putting down orange hazard tape.

I realize these examples are not unique to Rainer, rather part of a larger problem that has consumed the Park Service.  Nonetheless, I wonder if the current administration could appoint a new superintendent to Rainier National Park.  Surely an individual could be found who loves the park and wants more Americans to enjoy it.

Thanks for reading.
