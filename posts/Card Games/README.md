I played MTG from nearly it's start.  I remember a party in Middle School, likely 7th grade at Brian's house.  He's come across a few starter packs of either Alpha or Beta.  Notably there was a single volcanic island.  That meant he had to build a Blue/Red deck entirely around it.

At the time, it was impossible to get your hands on cards.  The local train and plastic model shop would periodically get a starter box of unlimited and immediately sell out.  Frustrated by that I took some index cards and made my own game.  My dad was a geologist, so it focused farm more on extinct creatures than high fantasy.  I really wish I still had those cards.  My dad had saved them but I threw theme away in cleaning out his house one time.  I can still picture sitting on his bed with my sister playing that surprisingly balanced but extremely slow game.

There'd been an earlier pollination game that wasn't collectible.  It was played from a set shared deck.  But it had some mechanics that in retrospect feel like MTG.  Another game called Predator focused on building a food chain.

What seemed like years but I'm sure was days or weeks later, my mom bought me and my friend Marco either a starter deck.  I think he spent the night, sleeping in my other bunk bed that night.  His starter pack had a Shivan Dragon which I *had* to have.  I'm pretty sure I traded every card of use in that deck for the dragon.  Marco got really good at trading and ultimately scaled his way up to multiple lotuses and such.  

When Arabian Nights came out we were living in St. Louis.  My mom bought a whole bunch of packs for me and my sister.  She really liked the Guardian Beast, I think because she thought it looked cool.  So, she was always trying to make that work.  Similarly I was trying to make combos like circle of protection work with orcish archers.  The juice was not worth the squeeze.  But, it's a game after all.

At this time, there was a sudden profusion of card games.  They all followed the random distribution in packs moden.  Vampire the Masquerade, a really neat dragon one called Wyvern, a D&D one, many more I can't remember and then Star Trek.  My friends tried to play most of them but didn't have the critical mass of cards needed for playable decks.  It was Brian's volcanic island deck all over again.

All these games had in common the notion that a player built their own deck and played against another player.  That seems to be the fundamental innovation in these games.

Today there's used to be a game called Illuminati.  It still exists today.  I could swear it used to be collectible.  It now seems to be fixed decks.  I have this feeling because I had like two booster packs worth or something and couldn't quite make it work as a game.  By the time I got my hands on it, I was well familar with Robert Anton Wilson, so thought the theme was great.

Star Trek was fundamentally broken in that you played a card called Red Alert and then emptied your hand.  The goal was exploring, not damage, which was cool.  I liked that the TNG bridge crew wasn't ridiculously rare.  It was less money grab than MTG that way.

In my first, and I believe only, touranment another kid had all his maybe 5000 cards in a single deck.  The judges argued over how to have him shuffle and ultimately gave up.  I think he'd invented a version of magic where you drew from different piles.  Clearly that wasn't going to be allowed in the tourament setting.

The ultimate winner of that tournament was probably 40.  He destroyed a bunch of kids with his much larger budget.  By this point, it was pretty clear that Time Walk, Ancestral Recall, Timetwister, Black Lotus, Mox and so forth were the way to win.  I think the restricted list had even arrived on the scene.

In this I'm reminded of Marco's plague rat deck which featured a bunch of power nine to make it more competitive.  I have a memory of sitting on my dad's porch with some cheeeky white deck that was badly thrown together to counteract the plague rats.  I had a circle of protection black and was trying to keep my lands ahead of the 15+/15+ plague rats that just kept coming.

I think I got tail end of Unlimited.  Then it was on to Revised by the time I was in St. Louis.  Arabian Nights came out then.

Which I bought a couple translations of recently.  One is a modern one with commentary.  It's kinda hilarious how concerned the comments are about the content.  The Sir whatever translation from 100+ years ago is far less apologetic.

I had basically no Dark or Legends, just a tiny bit of Ice Age and some Antiquities.  When Ice Age came out I remember playing a game at the shop by Table Mesa against the vastly better funded 40 year olds.  I was losing to cards I did recognize.  In a fit a frustration I played Balance against a table of maybe 8 people.  They killed me before my next turn.  I don't think I was particularly welcome there in the future.

I remember being very excited for Fallen Empires and then stopped playing with Homelands.  I'd moved away and friends were doing other things.

Sometime around 2015 I gave all my cards to a friend.  I knew he'd started playing a bit and thought it might be fun.  Little did I realize that they were worth the downpayment on a pretty decent house.  And there's the rub.

These are games.  They're for fun.  It's no fun to play against some guy who laid out $100k when you're in it for shits and giggles.  I'm thinking a bit about how to put together a game that is fun for a casual player (say $20 to start, $60 outlay to be in a decent position, perhaps $500 ceiling for 80% of people) but could still be customized more for fun than power creep.  I always loved winning a game of C&C or Starcraft with one unit type more for the amusement of myself than anyone else.
