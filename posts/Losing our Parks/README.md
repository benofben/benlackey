# Losing our Parks

<p><img src="IMG_1799.jpg" width="300"></p>

I've written many times about losing our parks.  There are so many examples of closed public lands, National Parks facilities blocked off in the name of fortress preservation or, as in the case of the Sunrise Lodge at Mount Rainier, turned into administrative offices.

Today we were at Paradise at Rainier.  Parks closed off the sledding area years ago.  People still come up hoping to sled.  Today there was a ranger on a power trip with dual guns shouting at a group of tourists.  Among other things he shouted "this isn't a recreation area."  He said this as we were standing on a trail 100ft from Paradise lodge.

I gave him my usual earful.  I figure I may as well because others might be afraid to.  He was asking the tourists for IDs and clearly trying to scare them with his federal powers.

I've written Rainier, the NPS, the NFS and so on numerous times.  It's pointless.  The organizations are fundamentally rotten.

It's extra strange that sledding is banned at Paradise but skiing is allowed.  I'm sure Parks would love to ban skiing too in the namem of fortress preservation.  I suspect however that the yuppie backcountry ski lobby is too powerful.  So, they let sleeping dogs lie and harass sledders instead.
