Sometimes think it might be fun to work as a window cleaner.  I'm sitting at Curran watching an old guy do that.  His hoodie says “The Window Streaker.”  

The guy who did most of the storefronts in Boulder was Warren.  He also had some ridiculous nickname in the window washer community like Cobra of something.  He was very into medium format photography.
