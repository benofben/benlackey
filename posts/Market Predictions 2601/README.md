# Market Predictions 2601

The most believable lens I've seen through which to view what is currently happening is [Dalio's How Countries Go Broke](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Investment-Economic-Ray-Dalio/dp/1501124064/).  It takes his more broad characterization of short and long term economic cycles.  It then discusses how that framework applies to what is going on currently.

He argues we're reaching the end of a long term economic cycle that kicked of with the end of WWII.  As that cycle winds down, debts are up.  The US is sustaining itself by deficit spending.  It is able to do so because the dollar is the world's reserve currency.  If (when) our spending exceeds the appetite for dollars, this will end.  Because the debts are denoniminated in dollars, it ends with the debts inflated away through printing.  There is no need to default, so it is unlikely we will.

I broadly believe this framework.  What I have far less confidence on is the specifics of how it plays out.

We're already seeing political extremism.  Both the right and left are claiming that previously unjustifiable actions are now justified.  We're seeing leftists carting guns around to challenge federal officials.  We're seeing rights curbed to make law enforcement possible in this context.  The whole thing is a mess and people are quite touchy about it.  One thing which is clear to me is that both sides are wrong.  They're engaging in activities that erode civil society for all.  Worse, if you point that out, the refrain is inevitably that of a petutlant child -- "but he did XXX."

Gandhi summarized this well as "an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."  At some point, I think we'll back off the reciprocal eye poking.  However, my guess is this has some way to go.

To me, the world is becoming increasingly unrecognizable.  I think I see that most with free speech.  The traditional leftist allies of free speech now argue for restrictions.  The restrictions on the right are more recognizable to me, though no more desirable.

I think we're overestimating change in the next year.  I remember a friend in 2016 giving odds on "the fall of the republic."  We're still here but things are certainly different.  While I certainly recognize that governments fall, I suspect that is unlikely, particularly in a close in time frame.  I don't particularly believe Trump will be the cause if it does.  He seems, more likely, a symptom of larger problems.

## Most Likely Scenario
Trump replaces Powell at the end of term in May 2026.  The new appointee is extremely dovish.  They cut rates.

That stimulates economic growth.  There are very real deflationary powers.  At least in the near term that spending might not be inflationary.  I suspect, however, that once unleashed (again) we won't have the willpower to raise rates.  What Volcker did under Reagan seems impossible today.  So, it really seems like we'll print until we saturate the market for dollars.

I used to think a new reserve currency would need to step in.  The ongoing challenge has been there is no replacement contender.   The goldbugs have had a rough 200 years or so.  Maybe they will finally be right. 

I wonder now if we'll just see a return to hard currency.  I remain deeply skeptical of crypto either as a store of value or medium of exchange.  It is comically bad at both roles.

Regardless, it seems most likely the scenario is:

* Short term (1-2 year boom) - Non-inflationary stimulus.  Despite official figures that the economy is faring well, the statistics don't seem to capture what many people are experiencing.  One possible culprit is an AI boom that hasn't provided broad benefit.
* Long term (5-10 year) - Monetization of debt until no appetite remains.  Crash.  Austerity and reset to hard money.  Recovery in 2040 or so?

## The End of the Republic
One scenario would be Trump remaining in office after his term ends.  That seems unlikely to me, but similar things have certainly ended many democracies.

Such a scenario presumably leads to further eroded civil liberties.  The regime ends with his death, at the outer limits not too far off due to natural causes.  Perhaps some child is set up as successor.  The Roman Empire to Roman Republic transition is perhaps informative here.

There is, of course, the flip side.  Some leftist extremist Mamdani type seizes power and curtails liberties in their own way.  These extremes look remarkably similar.  As Popper notes, the enemy of open society is closed society.

If such a thing were to happen, my personal preference would be to find myself in a small town, presumably ignored by the broader goings on.  Something similar worked out for some Germans in the 40s, but was by no means panacea and certainly did nothing to end the attrocities going on about them.  It is very hard to live in the world and apart from it.

I'm not sure it's worth worrying too much about these scenarios.  In the event they happen, contingency planning doesn't help much.  Maybe some gold buried somewhere does.  But, it's difficult to perform portfolio optimization that is violent revolution proof.  Capital markets tend to disintegrate as people have more immediate priorities.  Contracts, even if you bet correctly, don't prove valid.

I suspect it's more prudent to optimize for some likely scenario while ensuring you won't be (to borrow a Buffettism) caught swimming with no pants when the tide goes out.  Probably that just means escaping to a far away place to wash dishes with your advanced degree if everything goes well and truly wrong.  That was common enough with Soviet block immigrants in the US after the fall of the wall.  Perhaps roles will reverse 40 years later.
