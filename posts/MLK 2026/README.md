# MLK 2026

Today is MLK day.  We're about to go for a hike.  We have the day off because MLK did good things for the country.  Similarly his "I have a dream" speech is well known for good reason.  The full text of it is [here](https://www.npr.org/2010/01/18/122701268/i-have-a-dream-speech-in-its-entirety).

Some of my favorite lines are these:

> I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.

Expressing a similar notion, Haile Selassie gave a [speech to the UN in 1963](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie%27s_address_to_the_United_Nations,_1963):

> Until this is accomplished, mankind's future remains hazardous and permanent peace a matter for speculation. 

Bob Marley took the idea and ran with it in his song [War](https://genius.com/Bob-marley-and-the-wailers-war-lyrics).  

> Until the colour of a man's skin
> Is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes
> Me say war

Thomas Jefferson put it [this way](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript):

> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

The idea is the same throughout -- treating people differently because of their inalterable characteristics is a recipe for disaster.  Racism is not a recipe for a for a functioning society.

In high school I was somehow part of a small group of students who got to hear Desmund Tutu speek and later briefly say hi to him.  He had a similar sentiment.  He told us the proper way to prounounce apratheid is "apart hate" because that is what being apart inevitably leads to.  I suspect Tutu was not a big fan of "separate but equal."

Oxford Languages gives a definition of racism as:

> Prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.

Racial discrimination is then defined as:

> The belief that different races possess distinct characteristics, abilities, or qualities, especially so as to distinguish them as inferior or superior to one another.

Recently an idea of antiracism has become popular.  That was codified in the book "[How to Be an Antiracist](https://www.ibramxkendi.com/how-to-be-an-antiracist)."  The book is a certain kind of academically obtuse.  The core thesis is: "The opposite of ‘racist’ isn’t ‘not racist.’ It is ‘antiracist.'"

Being antiracist is never clearly defined.  Instead you get gems like this:

> Some White people do not identify as White for the same reason they identify as not-racist: to avoid reckoning with the ways that Whiteness—even as a construction and mirage—has informed their notions of America and identity and offered them privilege, the primary one being the privilege of being inherently normal, standard, and legal.

Around the idea of antiracism an academic edifice has been constructed that is definitively racist.  It's shown up in things like the [deintegration of graduation ceremonies at Stanford](https://events.stanford.edu/event/black-graduation-ceremony-and-reception).  That's right, 50 years after the Civil Rights movement people are now free to attend segregated graduation ceremonies.

Another example of contemporary segregationists comes this week from Minnesota State Senator Omar Fateh.  [He has proposed](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-sorry-omar-fateh-were-not-doing-somali-run-no-go-zones-minnesota) "no go zones" for "white supremacists."  I am strongly suspicious that Fateh's definition of a white supremacist is rather broad.  Despite Fateh's ambitions, In America people are free to go anywhere on public property, regardless of how unpalatable their views may be to some.  That is as it should be.

All these ideas aren't particular new, they just have new words around them.  While MLK was doing good, Malcolm X was waving a gun about preaching "by any means necesary."

Further back [Marcus Garvey was meeting with the KKK](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/months-past/marcus-garvey-meets-kkk) discussing how their segregationist goals aligned.

George Orwell noticed the hypocritical tendencies of leftist extremists.  In 1984, poking at this, he wrote: "War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength."

I'm pretty sure that was intended as a warning, not a guide.

Propaganda and oppression are inherently unstable.  Ultimately they collapse under their own weight.  Gandhi put it rather simply: "An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind."

In the realm of mutual blindness, an idea has become popular recently to pay enormous amounts in reparations.  We don't seem to actually do it, but boy do we love talking about it.  San Francisco, in the state of California, a state that never had slavery is proposing paying [$5m per person](https://www.newsweek.com/black-californians-5-million-reparations-new-law-11290333) to people supposedly harmed by slavery.

So, today, on MLK day, I'm thinking about what sort of society I would like to live in.  It is the one MLK, Haile Selassie, Bob Marley and their ilk imagined.   Getting there involves discarding illiberal policies including identity politics, cynically named anti racism and political violence.
