# MLK 2026

Today is MLK day.  We're about to go for a hike.  We have the day off because MLK did good things for the country.  Similarly his "I have a dream" speech is well known for good reason.  The full text of it is [here](https://www.npr.org/2010/01/18/122701268/i-have-a-dream-speech-in-its-entirety).

Some of my favorite lines are these:

> I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.

Expressing a similar notion, Haile Selassie gave a [speech to the UN in 1963](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie%27s_address_to_the_United_Nations,_1963):

> Until this is accomplished, mankind's future remains hazardous and permanent peace a matter for speculation. 

Bob Marley took the idea and ran with it in his song [War](https://genius.com/Bob-marley-and-the-wailers-war-lyrics).  

> Until the colour of a man's skin
> Is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes
> Me say war

Thomas Jefferson put it [this way](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript):

> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

The idea is the same throughout -- treating people differently because of their inalterable characteristics is a recipe for disaster.  Racism is not a recipe for a for a functioning society.

In high school I was somehow part of a small group of students who got to hear Desmund Tutu speek and later briefly say hi to him.  He had a similar sentiment.  He told us the proper way to prounounce apratheid is "apart hate" because that is what being apart inevitably leads to.  I suspect Tutu was not a big fan of "separate but equal."

Propaganda and oppression are inherently unstable.  Ultimately they collapse under their own weight.  An inspiration to MLK in the field on civil disobedience, Gandhi, put it rather simply: "An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind."

So, today, on MLK day, I'm thinking about what sort of society I would like to live in.  It is the one MLK, Haile Selassie, Bob Marley and their ilk imagined.   Getting there involves discarding illiberal policies including, but not limited to political violence.
