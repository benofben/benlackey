# What is WOW

People who've known me a while, back in the halcyon days of the late 90s, may remember nonplatonic.com.  It was, among other things, a blog before blogs were called blogs. The original version was some Perl that spat out static HTML.

People who've known me a while have also heard me complain about the state of the web, particularly the walled gardens that have taken over.  So, [WideOpenWeb.com](WideOpenWeb.com) is an attempt to fight back against that.  I've written a bit about the motivations.

You'll likely start seeing more posts from me, both as a user and writing about it.  The code is all available here:
