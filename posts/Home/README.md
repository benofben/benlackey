I've moved around a lot.  I wrote about that some in a recent piece of [losing the city council election](https://www.reddit.com/r/TacomaPolitics/comments/1op9p8e/im_a_loser_baby/).  I fear I may have judged Tacoma correctly but may not have the fortitude to endure it.

Broadly I'm concerned about an erosion in civil society.  It is most damning with the disintegration of free speech.  There is a reason that's the 1st ammendment.  That rot, a broken window in our society, has correlated with, perhaps even caused other issues.  Instituions are malfunctioning.  Basic work is not happening.  It was suprising to me that even advocating to properly pave roads was controversial in the election.  If we can't agree on something the Romans were able do 2000 years ago, it's no wonder other basic services like police and schools are a mess.

One solution is to hunker down and throw up walls.  The neighborhood in Tacoma we live in has done that before.  From what I understand, the 80s were pretty rough.  I believe they are currently doing that again as a the pre COVID era boom winds down.

The other day, driving through downtown, I noticed an all too typical sight -- a man laid down in a store entrance.  He'd likely overdosed.  I didn't call the police.  I assume no one else did.  I've put in 100s of calls and tickets.  At best they take the person to the hospital and nearly immediately release them.  There is no help for that man.  All that is on offer is the new liberal compassion -- we express pity, we say we want to help, we pour money into programs that excaberate the problems -- but the one thing that would fix the issue, cutting off the drugs and helping someone up and out, is not on offer.

In the contemporary insanity we're told that science and evidence don't back common sense soutions like shelter and sobriety.  Apparently the experimental method is not part of this "science."  Instead, we are told that paradoxically, the answer to homelessness and addiction is homelessness and addiction.  It is something straight from the pages of 1984.

The solutions described in [Back from the Brink](https://www.amazon.com/Back-Brink-Inside-Citys-Extraordinary/dp/0197797776/) are now too controversial even for NYC where they perviously succeeded.  

It's no accident that NY, CA and WA have the worse homeless issues in the country.  These states have cultivated the issues with substandard pseudo housing for the homeless, the encouragement of drug use and the silencing of any dissenter who might argue such things are a bad idea.

Part of the issue is lack of children.  Without children there need be no future.  The calculus of society no longer includes perpetuation rather a hedonistic maximization at the current point in time.  It's hilariously ironic that the proponents of this are the same people repeating "sustainability" like a mantra.

Tacoma recently elected Bromwyn Clarke to Parks Board.  During the election she argued that if parks are truly public spaces, we should allow homeless camps in them.  She will now get to put that idea into expanded practice.  We were already pretty lenient with the camps in parks even before her.  Amazingly she's Oxford educated.  I'm just bewildered at the people top schools are putting out.  Something has gone ridiculously wrong.  To Clarke, the idea of a well cared for public good is foreign.  She has an idealized view of the homeless, not understanding that garbage bonfires and needles are the output of homeless camps.

This ruins parks for everyone.  The rich ignore it because they have private parks which are well cared for -- in Tacoma the lawn and tennis club is an excellent example.  If things get bad enough, the rich simply leave.  The poor forget what public goods were once available.  Instead, there's a vicious cycle, resetting only once things have become extremely degraded.

While I know this intellectually, it's painful to see the downswing.  My personal experiences have been primarily on the upswing, seeing cities that had a rough time of white flight and deindustrialization rebuilding through the past 2-3 decades.  Dalio, Soros and Popper all discuss the fundamental nature of the cycle.  It's something that results from human nature.  I believe it derives fundamentally from our limited life spans.  That's why we see long term credit cycles on the order of 100 years and short term at 10 years.

One answer is to build a castle within a collapsing city.  I've seen how this plays out in Mexico, India, Indonesia, South Africa and probably some others I'm forgetting about.  It's bad for everyone.  Even the castle dweller does poorly, living in fear of his jealous neighbors.

Another answer is to remove yourself to a wealthy area that holds the problems at a distance.  Boulder is now in many ways that.  Jackson is another.  Ski towns, the Hamptons and such all have similar traits.  These wealthy enclaves are in many ways safe from the disintegration of the American Dream.

That leaves the question of what places may exist where that dream is still alive.

I'm now going to consider different cities, mostly through the light of if they make sense for me.

## Boulder
I grew up, among other places, in Boulder.  If I could move to Boulder in 1995, I would.  Boulder 30 years later is a different thing.  It may still be desirable but is not the eay choice the Boulder of yesteryear would be.

This is, once again, down to civic life.  Boulder was rousted from its rustic roots by a bunch of hippies.  They did things like use public funds to buy up space around the city and declare that park.  To limit sprawl they refused to supply water to houses above 7000ft.  This gave the city additional decades to continue its open space buying program.

The hippies closed Pearl St to traffic, creating one of the first pedestrian malls in the country.  This mall hilariously has the same lights and trash cans as a similar mall in Iowa City.

These policies made Boulder a nice place to live.  Boulder has great outdoors and an excellent university.  Government employers like NIST and NCAR benefitted from having that university nearby.  Employers like Sun (now Oracle) and IBM set up show in the suburbs.  More recently Google opened up shop.

All this made Boulder more expensive.  Modern Boulderites feel bad about that.  9% of the housing stock is affordable with a goal to bring that number to 15%.  Nevermind economics.  The only way Boulder housing is going to be affordable is if policies are enacted that ruin Boulder.

## Colorado Springs
Boulder has a median single family home price of $1.25m.  It's only $445k in Colorado Springs against a national number of $462k.

## Nashville
