# Friends

Friend groups change.  I know this intellectually but not emotionally.

I have a tendency to collect friends and hang on to them for decades.  Business travel has made this easier.  In global roles, I've found myself regularly passing through major cities.  That's made it possible to maintain friendships that might have otherwise atrophied decades prior.

I am highly guilty of being sentimental.  I recognize it doesn't serve me well.  However, I don't particularly like people who aren't.  I don't particular think success is its own end.  Rather, it needs to be enjoyed.  That enjoyment, if not purely hedonistic, ultimately seems to come back to sentiment, or perhaps idealism.  The two intermingle.

In this, I've noticed that I assume I am closer to people I've known a long time than I actually am.  They live rent free in my head, often idealized.  So, sometimes the reality of who they are or what they think can be jarring.

I recall visiting a friend at a new house.  A house had one of those "in this house we believe..." signs.  I thought -- that can't be his house.  He would never engage in that sort of groupthink.  I was incorrect.

This is a challenge with the golden rule.  It is difficult to do unto others as you would have them do unto you if you have vastly different views of what should be done.  That model only works when values are shared.

I have long subsisted on a very strange media diet.  My early reading consisted largely of outdated hard sci fi -- Clarke 30 years too late and such.  Middle and high school included Vonnegut.  That was similarly out of date.  Player Piano was written in 1952.  I was reading it in the early 90s.  I read Pinchon, Ginsberg, etc.

Then in college I traveled even further back in time.  My favorite period was probably 20s Paris -- Hemmingway, Miller, Celine.  Though, I made forays into Goethe, Maugham, Spinoza.  I read Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia.  I read Franklin's Notes on the State of Pennsylvannia.  And, I read all these things, not as you do in school to write some essay no one will ever read, but for education.  I read them to learn from people who I viewed as great.

The result is that my world view and morality became increasingly anachronistic.  My wife sometimes says I'm "Boomer coded."  I think it's probably more Lost Generation.  In some sense, I view cars and aeroplanes as new fangled.  Conrad Hilton's autobiography (Be My Guest, it's excellent!) seems relatable to me, more so than something more contemporary.
