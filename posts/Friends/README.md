# Friends

Friend groups change.  I know this intellectually but not emotionally.

I have a tendency to collect friends and hang on to them for decades.  Business travel has made this easier.  In global roles, I've found myself regularly passing through major cities.  That's made it possible to maintain friendships that might have otherwise atrophied decades prior.

I am highly guilty of being sentimental.  I recognize it doesn't serve me well.  However, I don't particularly like people who aren't.  I don't particularly think success is its own end.  Rather, it needs to be enjoyed.  That enjoyment, if not purely hedonistic, ultimately seems to come back to sentiment, or perhaps idealism.  The two intermingle.

In this, I've noticed that I assume I am closer to people I've known a long time than I actually am.  They live rent free in my head, often idealized.  So, sometimes the reality of who they are or what they think can be jarring.

I recall visiting a friend at a new house.  A house had one of those "in this house we believe..." signs.  I thought -- that can't be his house.  He would never engage in that sort of groupthink.  I was incorrect.

This is a challenge with the golden rule.  It is difficult to do unto others as you would have them do unto you if you have vastly different views of what should be done.  That model only works when values are shared.

I have long subsisted on a very strange media diet.  My early reading consisted largely of outdated hard sci fi -- Clarke 30 years too late and such.  On a clock radio with a glowing red readout I listened to Casey Kasem announcing the hits of New Wave sometime shortly after learning to walk.

Middle and high school included Vonnegut.  That was similarly out of date.  I listened to Madness while my peers played Nirvana.  Player Piano was written in 1952.  I was reading it in the early 90s.  I read Pinchon, Ginsberg, etc.

Then in college I traveled even further back in time.  My favorite period was probably 20s Paris -- Hemmingway, Miller, Celine.  I listened to Caruso because Miller and Hemmingway liked him.  Going further back, reading their favorites, I made forays into Goethe, Maugham, Spinoza.  I read Spengler's Decline of the West with an eye to the present as Miller must have done decades prior.  I read Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia.  I read Franklin's Notes on the State of Pennsylvannia.  And, I read all these things, not as you do in school to write some essay no one will ever read, but for education.  I read them to learn from people who I viewed as great.

I also learned to pick the good things out.  Ezra Pound was a fascist after some mental break.  But he was also a great poet.  You can enjoy the poetry without a goosestep.  Bukowski could write but I think few would argue he was a particularly good person.  The list goes on.  It's become popular recently to apply contemporary mores to people who lived hundereds of years ago.  When they inevitably don't measure up to the rules of a society they never knew, we discard them and all their ideas.  This is foolish.  Running past art through such a sieve will leave us precisely nothing.

The result is that my world view and morality became increasingly anachronistic.  My wife sometimes says I'm "Boomer coded."  I think it's probably more Lost Generation.  In some sense, I view cars and aeroplanes as new fangled.  Conrad Hilton's autobiography (Be My Guest, it's excellent!) seems relatable to me, more so than something more contemporary.

At some point I emerged from school.  I pretty quickly discovered that there was little interest in 20s Paris and discarded it, except for my own personal reveries.  I found in my working life that I got on extroadinarily well with Boomers.  I wonder a bit if they found my world view reassuring as it was likely roughly in line with their parents.  Perhaps it reminded them of childhood.  Regardless, it's been sad to see them retire and replaced with people who have rather different principles, if they have principles at all.  

More frequently than I like, I've encountered Silicon Valley executives who seem to be Nihilists.  Of course, this is perhaps not a new phenemenon.  Twain once quipped -- "If you want to know what God thinks of money, look at the people he gives it to."  The phenomenon is perhaps even older.  

I was recently reading Marcus Aurelius's Mediations and was struck by how little he believes in.  It seems almost a direct precursor to Machiavelli.  I guess it's not surprising it's a favorite of the tech bro types.  The philosophy may be utilitarian.  But the life it leads to doesn't seem worth living.

I recall an anecdote from some long form thing, perhaps an Atlantic article.  The author was talking to her mom.  The mom lived in one of those Florida mega retirement areas.  She complained of having few friends. The daughter asked "why not make more?"  The response was "there's not time."  

That sentiment seems self fulfilling.  If you stop speaking with others, death will probably follow quickly.  I'm reminded of this line from the classic "Wear Sunscreen"

> The most interesting people I know didn’t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don’t.

If you do the same thing every day, life disappears quickly.  Varied activites somehow stretch time.  That seems key.  Keep meeting new people and doing new things.  The prizes for consistency probably aren't worth the price.  

I'm reminded of a friend in his 40s who is concerned with how he will pay for his own memory care.  Having watched my dad forced through that, I feel strongly that the memory care life is not worth living.  Live the life while you can.  Die before it becomes terrible.

In all this the times will change.  What was popular will not be.  Things that seem immovable move.  Rules that are written in stone erode to dust.  And, it often turns out that a more which is firm in one place is completely unknown in another, even at the same moment.  

I don't for a moment sucumb to post modernism.  I believe right and wrong exist.  I think they are fundamental to the human condition.  No god is needed to explain that murder is wrong.  Rather, most people share a belief that it is not pleasant to be murdered.  It's important to hang on to those self evident truths even while navigating a world where some place emphasis on them and others do not.

When I was younger I spoke up a lot because I thought I had nothing to lose.  I suspect I have more to lose today.  However, I try to continue to speak up for my anachronistic (but I believe correct) views because, while the distance to fall may be greater, I am in many ways better able to weather it today.  Beyond hedonism, much of the benefit of success is independence.  That independence allows a greater degree of speech than might otherwise be possible.

I love it when people exercise that.  It's great to see people like Soros, Thiel, Gates and Dalio all expressing their views because they success has ensured independence.  What is shameful in this is that we now live in a society where the mob curtails speech to such an extent that many cannot speak openly.  The 1st ammendement protects you from the government but not the mob. 

We're going through a very rough moment for free speech and varied ideas.  I suspect free speech in the US probably peaked in the late 90s / early 2000s with cyberutopianism and myriad people publishing their own websites.  As the web matured we learned how to mob censor people on it.  Walled gardens sprang up that censored further.  Now we're in a moment of significant censorship.  Bizarely any sort of pornography is permissible, yet many political and artistic views are not.  I know these moments sometimes last decades.  In what we now call "the dark ages" they lasted centuries.  I hope I live to see the end of this one.
