# The Future as of 2025

"It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future."

― Yogi Berra

I periodically write an investment thesis.  That's usually pretty detailed with my holdings and how I think they might be impacted by the future.  Writing it down helps me go back and evaluate if I was correct or am suffering from revisionism within my mind.  

As I'm broadly optimistic, I want to avoid the fate I think Trump has suffered where his touch retards returns.  I've seen calculations that his career would have better been spent doing nothing and index investing.  Of course, that may be different now that his presidency drives the value of his meme coins.... anyway...

## US Macro

Everyone wants to be a macro investor.  Broadly we're neccesarily far worse at it than we believe we are.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed [Dalio's recent book](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Investment-Economic-Ray-Dalio/dp/1501124064/) and have opinions.

I've been betting on an inflationary episode since 2012.  That's when I bought my first condo.  The interest rate was 3.5% with a 3.5% downpayment.  It was an FHA with PMI that I ultimately got removed through refinance.  The property itself has had dubious return.  The value went up but costs did too.  Maitenance and turnover are always challenging.  The return has been good but solely because of leverage.

Following that first entry were many more.  I've now got real estate with about 32% equity if Zillow values are to be believed.  My models assume 3% inflation.  Since 2012, the real number has been higher than that.  The official target is 2%.  We've overshot that, particularly through the Biden COVID stimulus with official numbers peaking around 10%.  My belief is that official figures are understating true inflation.  The $9 romanesco at Met Market the other day seems a sign.

The Fed is easing despite 3% inflation.  That brings into question just how serious they are about that 2% target.  I feel strongly that when Powell's term is up in May 2026, he will get the boot.  Trump will appoint someone more ammenable to unprincipled rate cuts.  I am picturing something quite different from the Volcker era, though with somewhat similar starting conditions.

Both sides of the aisle are winning votes by promising unfunded social benefits.  I don't think Dalio's program of cuts is politically possible.  So, I think we'll end up with the alternative he lays out -- spending until it can't go on any longer.

We've already had bond auctions with limited uptake from the typical foreign buyers.  Under Biden we went full steam ahead monetizing debt.  I think we're going to embrace that fully over the next 5-10 years until the inflation because too painful domestically.

At that point the foreign debt will have been largely inflated away.  The same could be said of 30 year fixed rate mortgages.  It's blackly humorous to me that proposed fixes to housing costs aren't "build more."  Rather both sides of the aisle are trying to do more with less.  Mamdani, etal want to fix costs.  That has never worked, not once.  

Trump proposed the 50 year mortgage.  That, like lowering rates, will simply drive asset prices up.  It will do nothing for affordability in real terms.

So, what's the impact?

Dollar loses reserve currency status.  I think this already would have happened if there were a viable replacement.  

* Gold - Crazy run up as a result of international instability.  Just difficult to work with.  It's conceivable that in an economic reset a major country returning to gold backing could see uptake of their currency.  That would hinge on the country being stable and trustworthy enough to not immediately print.
* Bitcoin  - neither a store of value nor a medium of exchange.
* Euro - Weak economies supporting it.  Disjointing monetary policy driven by member states with competiting agendas.
* Yuan - Little international faith in China to behave well.

Regardless of what the reset moment looks like, a 5-20 year period of inflation seems likely to me.  The US has too much debt and no will to reduce spending much less pay it off.  "If something can't go on forever, it will stop."  I think the only realistic way out is inflation, pain, then a reset.
